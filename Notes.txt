Training
>> python train.py -h
By default, the scale is 0.5, so if you wish to obtain better results (but use more memory), set it to 1.
Automatic mixed precision is also available with the --amp flag. Mixed precision allows the model to use less memory and to be faster on recent GPUs by using FP16 arithmetic. Enabling AMP is recommended.

Testing
After training your model and saving it to MODEL.pth, you can easily test the output masks on your images via the CLI.

To predict a single image and save it:
>> python predict.py -i <image.jpg> -o <output.jpg> -m <model.pth>

To predict a multiple images and show them without saving them:
>> python predict.py -i <image1.jpg image2.jpg> --viz --no-save
